> How well can you understand what's going on inside the system by asking questions from outside the system?

Around 2016, observability engineering wasn't yet widely known in tech. Just few companies had tools that managed tracing and metrics, like Facebook and Google, but were used just for a defined set of their products, so it wasn't an open practice for the whole community

The evolution of systems along those years started to became much more distributed than it was before, with a variety of errors and unpredictable problems, that's why investing in observability started to became a trend within the industry

To understand better about observability, it's also important to understand the role of SRE. The goal of SREs is to try to make systems easier to operate for the people are working on them, one of the key considerations in terms of ensuring the system is highly available is thinking about what are your SLOs, what are your reliability goals for the system and how to achieve those goals

What happens if there is an incident? Does it take five minutes to fix or does it take three hours to fix? That's where observability comes in, as a technique to ensure that you can understand novel problems on your system

Nowadays when we think about observability, there's one question that comes into place: Can you understand what's happening in your system and why, without having to push new code, and should do so very quick by slicing and dicing existing data that you already have in terms of telemetry signals
