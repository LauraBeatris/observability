## :orange_book: Observability Notebook

A single source of truth of my learning journey of topics regarding observability engineering and SRE 

### :round_pushpin: Repo Structure 

In a nutshell, there are two main folders with different goals:
- [notes](./notes): Notes that I took throughout my study routine, in which others can read for their own study purposes
- [practice](./practice): Hands-on applications from what I learned throughout my study sessions 

### :pencil2: Notes Structure
Here's a concise summary of what you can expect from each notes subfolder 
- [observability](./notes/observability/): General concepts of observability, such as: definition, key areas, monitoring vs observability, cardinality
- [logging](./notes/logging): Specific notes around logging with code snippets of tools like [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
- [monitoring](./notes/monitoring): Specific notes around monitoring, covering topics such as: Monitoring antipatterns, principles of monitoring design
- [tracing](./notes/tracing): Specific notes around tracing, with code implementations and examples of using tools like [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
